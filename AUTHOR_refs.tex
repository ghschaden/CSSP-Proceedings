% Please use this file (which you should rename) for the references of
% your paper. Be sure to compile the master file, not this one.

% Important: Since we're using natbib, you should cite references in
% your main text in the way required by natbib (e.g. \citet{},
% \citealt{}, etc.). Consult the natbib documentation (natnotes.pdf,
% natbib.pdf) for this.

% The preferred way to format your references is to use BibTeX. For
% this, please use the BibTeX style file glossa.bst (from Glossa).

%\bibliographystyle{glossa}

% Uncomment the following line and specify the name of your BIB file
% (without the suffix .bib):

%\bibliography{AUTHOR_bib}

\printbibliography

% Please be sure to always use an n-dash (--) for page intervals in your
% BIB file. For example, write "1--24" and not "1-24".
