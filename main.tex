%% In order to use this file as intended, you need to complete the
%% following 9 steps. (It should go quickly!)
%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 1 (The title; there are potentially three substeps)
%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 1a (The title of the paper on the first page)
%%%%%%%%%%

% Uncomment the following line and specify the title of your paper
% (forced line breaks with "\\" are allowed but not encouraged):

\renewcommand{\TitleOfPaper}{This Title Needs Changing And Is Also Super Long To Check What Happens On Odd Pages}
% If your Title is not too long, you can comment out the following 
% (the main title will automatically be set up as header on odd pages); 
% otherwise, please provide a short title for the running header:
\renewcommand{\TitleOfPaperInHeader}{This Title Needs Changed}

%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 1b (The title of the paper in the PDF metadata)
%%%%%%%%%%

% If the title of the paper on the first page (specified in step 2a)
% contains "\\" or an emphasized/italicized expression, then uncomment
% the following line and specify the title of the paper without "\\" and
% without an emphasized/italicized expression:

% \renewcommand{\TitleOfPaperpdfinfo}{The title of the paper without "\\" or emphasis/italics}

% (If the title of the paper specified in step 3a doesn't contain "\\"
% or emphasis/italics, then there's no need to set this and you can go
% to step 1c!)

%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 1c (The title of the paper in the running headers, if different)
%%%%%%%%%%

% If the title of the paper in the running headers differs from the
% title of the paper on the first page (specified in step 3a), then
% uncomment the following line and specify the title of the paper in the
% headers (note that no forced line breaks are allowed here):

% \renewcommand{\TitleOfPaperInHeader}{The title in the headers}

% (Normally, the title of the paper in the running headers is identical
% to the title of the paper on the first page, in which case there's no
% need to set this. But sometimes, the title of the paper in the running
% headers needs to be shortened a bit, in which case the shortened title
% should be specified here.)

%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 2 (The authors; there are up to five substeps, depending on the
%% number of authors)
%%%%%%%%%%

% First of all, how may authors does this paper have:
\renewcommand{\AuthorNumber}{5}
% If you indicate more authors than the number set here, these authors will simply be ignored.

% the first name of the first author:

% In certain cases, it may be more appropriate to give the first initial
% as a combination of two letters: an upper case letter followed
% immediately by a lower case letter. For example, if the first name is
% "Szilvia", the first initial would best be "Sz" (without the quotes,
% of course).

% Uncomment the following line and specify the last (family) name of the
% first author:

\renewcommand{\AuthorALastName}{Coward}

% Uncomment the following line and specify the affiliation of the first
% author (just the name of the institution):

\renewcommand{\AuthorAAffiliation}{Utopian University of Atlantis}

% Uncomment one of the following lines and specify EITHER the web page
% OR the email address of the first author (but not both; a web page is
% preferred).

% NOTE: If you want to use a tilde (~), put "\noexpand~" instead of "~"
% (without the quotes). This applies to the URLs of the other authors as
% well.

% \renewcommand{\AuthorAUrl}{http://web-page-author-1/}
\renewcommand{\AuthorAUrl}{anonymous.coward@utopian-atlantis.edu}
