% This is the main file for your paper. This is the file that you
% should compile.

\documentclass[a5paper,12pt,twoside]{article}% Please don't change

\usepackage{eiss}% Please don't change

% For your information, eiss.sty explicitly requires the following
% publicly available packages (most of which are probably already
% installed on recent LaTeX systems). Please don't reload these
% packages!

% (Note that you can latex the file check-for-packages.tex in order to
% check whether these packages are installed on your system.)

%% In order to use this file as intended, you need to complete the
%% following 12 steps. (It should go quickly!)
%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 1 (The font)
%%%%%%%%%%

% The official font for EISS 14 is Libertinus, which is preselected:


\UseLibertinus

% Alternative fonts are Latin Modern or Times:

% \UseLatinModern
% \UseTimes

% (Don't select Latin Modern or Times for EISS 13 unless the use of
% Utopia presents a problem. Note that ONLY ONE of these three font
% options should be selected.)

%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 2 (The input encoding)
%%%%%%%%%%

% Note: If you're using a version of LaTeX from 2018/04/01 or later,
% then UTF-8 is the default input encoding and it's no longer necessary
% to set the input encoding to utf8 explicitly.

% If you're directly inserting only ASCII (basically: non-accented)
% characters, then you don't have to explicitly set an input encoding,
% and you can go to step 3! If you're directly inserting some non-ASCII
% (accented) characters, then you have to choose an input
% encoding. Nowadays, the standard choice of non-ASCII input encoding is
% utf8. If you want to use this or another input encoding, uncomment the
% following line and specify the encoding that you want to use (and then
% make sure that you save your file in this encoding):

% \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

% (Some popular legacy encodings are latin1, latin2, latin9, cp1252, and
% cp1250.)

%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 3 (The title; there are potentially three substeps)
%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 3a (The title of the paper on the first page)
%%%%%%%%%%

% Uncomment the following line and specify the title of your paper
% (forced line breaks with "\\" are allowed but not encouraged):

\renewcommand{\TitleOfPaper}{This Title Needs Changed And Is Also Super Long To Check What Happens On Odd Pages}
% If your Title is not too long, you can comment out the following (the main title will automatically be set up as header on odd pages
\renewcommand{\TitleOfPaperInHeader}{This Title Needs Changed}

%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 3b (The title of the paper in the PDF metadata)
%%%%%%%%%%

% If the title of the paper on the first page (specified in step 3a)
% contains "\\" or an emphasized/italicized expression, then uncomment
% the following line and specify the title of the paper without "\\" and
% without an emphasized/italicized expression:

% \renewcommand{\TitleOfPaperpdfinfo}{The title of the paper without "\\" or emphasis/italics}

% (If the title of the paper specified in step 3a doesn't contain "\\"
% or emphasis/italics, then there's no need to set this and you can go
% to step 3c!)

%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 3c (The title of the paper in the running headers, if different)
%%%%%%%%%%

% If the title of the paper in the running headers differs from the
% title of the paper on the first page (specified in step 3a), then
% uncomment the following line and specify the title of the paper in the
% headers (note that no forced line breaks are allowed here):

% \renewcommand{\TitleOfPaperInHeader}{The title in the headers}

% (Normally, the title of the paper in the running headers is identical
% to the title of the paper on the first page, in which case there's no
% need to set this. But sometimes, the title of the paper in the running
% headers needs to be shortened a bit, in which case the shortened title
% should be specified here.)

%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 4 (The authors; there are up to five substeps, depending on the
%% number of authors)
%%%%%%%%%%

% First of all, how may authors do we have:
\renewcommand{\AuthorNumber}{5}

% author:

\renewcommand{\AuthorAFirstName}{Anonymous}

% Uncomment the following line and specify the first initial (letter) of
% the first name of the first author:

\renewcommand{\AuthorAFirstInitial}{A}

% In certain cases, it may be more appropriate to give the first initial
% as a combination of two letters: an upper case letter followed
% immediately by a lower case letter. For example, if the first name is
% "Szilvia", the first initial would best be "Sz" (without the quotes,
% of course).

% Uncomment the following line and specify the last (family) name of the
% first author:

\renewcommand{\AuthorALastName}{Coward}

% Uncomment the following line and specify the affiliation of the first
% author (just the name of the institution):

\renewcommand{\AuthorAAffiliation}{Utopian University of Atlantis}

% Uncomment one of the following lines and specify EITHER the web page
% OR the email address of the first author (but not both; a web page is
% preferred).

% NOTE: If you want to use a tilde (~), put "\noexpand~" instead of "~"
% (without the quotes). This applies to the URLs of the other authors as
% well.

%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 5 (Linguistic examples)
%%%%%%%%%%

% If you want to use phonetic (IPA) symbols in your linguistic examples,
% uncomment the following line to use the package tipa:

% \UseTipa

% linguex and expex are two well-known packages for formatting
% linguistic examples. If you wish to use one of these, uncomment the
% appropriate line below:

\UseLinguex

% \UseExpex

% If your paper contains many glossed examples, you may choose expex
% with a smaller font size instead in order to save some space:

% \UseExpexSmall

% But note that standard choice is \UseExpex and not \UseExpexSmall.

% If you prefer to use a different package for formatting linguistic
% examples, please specify it in the next step.

%%%%%%%%%%
%% Step 6 (Packages or definitions that you need)
%%%%%%%%%%

% Include here any \usepackage statements or definitions that you need
% for this paper, but please load only those packages that you REALLY
% NEED (and recall the list of already loaded packages given
% above). Note that the fonts, margins, etc. have already been set, so
% please don't try to override these.

% Please don't use hyperref! But remember to use \url{} for any URLs in
% your main text!

% Some suggestions:

% For extra LaTeX math symbols:

% \usepackage{latexsym}

% A well-known package for drawing syntactic trees:

% \usepackage[nocenter]{qtree}

% Add packages and definitions (again, only those that you really need
% for this paper!):

\usepackage[linguistics]{forest}
\usepackage{booktabs}
\usepackage{langsci-avm}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta}


%%%%%%%%%%
%% Nothing more to do here -- go to step 7!
%%%%%%%%%%

% Eventually we'll add a visible logo (please don't change):
% \renewcommand{\EISSlogo}{\includegraphics{eiss13_logo}}

\usepackage[firstpage]{draftwatermark}% Please don't change
% \usepackage{draftwatermark}%
\SetWatermarkFontSize{2.6cm}%
\SetWatermarkText{\shortstack{Draft\\ \today}}%
% \SetWatermarkText{\shortstack{Example\\ \today}}%
% \SetWatermarkText{\shortstack{Preview\\ \today}}

%% Set up the bibliography:
\addbibresource{AUTHOR_bib.bib}

\begin{document}% Please don't change

\label{PageFirst}% Please don't change

% We'd prefer not to put potentially misleading page numbers in the
% reference information on the first page until we know what the final
% page numbers will be, so for the time being we'll use 0 to 00:

\renewcommand{\FirstPage}{0}% Please don't change
\renewcommand{\LastPage}{00}

% Once we know which page your paper begins on, we'll uncomment the
% following line and set the value accordingly (please don't change):

% \setcounter{page}{137}

%%%%%%%%%%
